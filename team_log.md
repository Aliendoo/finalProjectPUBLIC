# Team Log üìù
## Details Final Project Progress and Team Contributions
**By Aileen, Rebecca, and Kaurvaki**

**`April 2nd`**

Aileen, Rebecca, and Kaurvaki all got together to meet up at the Science Center on Wednesday evening to work on Milestone 1. Aileen and Kaurvaki were at Crystal's office hours and reviewed Assignment 5 code to see what we had in common. Rebecca had class but met up with us once her class was over. We all worked together at one table with our laptops where we used Kaurvaki's laptop for the main coding. Everyone sat around Kaurvaki's laptop and we walked through our plan of how we would use our Assignment 5 code and Streamlit app planning to create our Wellesley Fresh Menu application. We brainstormed the layout of the app and decided to use st.form(). We really liked the calendar feature that ChatGPT came up with so we decided to use that code along with how to format it to have hyphen format. Once we added our Streamlit code, we customized our Streamlit app and learned more about config.toml. Then, we deployed the app and finished!
Everyone contributed equally and were involved in this milestone!


**`April 9th`**

**Kaurvaki** - For our app design, I worked on the user login and home dashboard pages in Canva and wrote about them in our Google Slides presentation.

**Aileen** - For the prototype, I worked on the food journal and the setting page, and wrote about how our ideas and designs for these pages connect to the Value Sensitive Design and Data Feminism.

**Rebecca** - For our prototype on canva, I worked on the data visualizations, community forums, and menu page and connected our design choices to VSD and data feminism in our presentation.

**Whole Team** - We met up virtually on Tuesday (April 8) to go over Milestone 2 and started planning what kind of app we wanted and brainstormed features. We met up again in-person on Wednesday (April 9) at Crystal's office hours (Aileen and I, Rebecca joined after her class) and continued working on designing the app on Canva and working on our Google Slides presentation. We finalized details like app name, color scheme, formatting, etc. Then, we worked on our team contract on a shared Google Doc. Finally, we worked on the ER diagramming using Draw.io and the whiteboards at the Science Center! We all met up today (right now as I'm writing) to wrap up our presentation and write this team log. Through our meetings, we made a lot of progress and worked efficiently together.

**`April 17th`**

**Aileen** - I worked on setting up the SQLite database and connected it to the food journal logging system. I also implemented the backend logic so that meal entries are saved and correctly displayed through the journal page.
